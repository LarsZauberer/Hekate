# Hekate
## A magical python game engine powered by panda3d and the panda3d render pipeline

# Installation
Tested with: Python 3.7.9

Note: Python 3.8+ is currently unsupported because panda3d has problems packaging the game to an exe with that version.
We hope this will be fixed soon. Other features may work.

1. Download the latest release
   [here](https://github.com/LarsZauberer/Hekate/releases)

2. Put the content of the `.zip` file into your project folder

3. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. Download Blender (tested with 2.9)

5. Download the latest `blendHekate.py` file and put it on Windows into `AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\<your blender version>\scripts\startup`. Note if the scripts and startup directory don't exist create them. If the whole `Blender Foundation` directory doesn't exist, start blender once and close it again.

# Getting Started
We have tutorials on how to do stuff with Hekate in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/LarsZauberer/Hekate/wiki) of this repository.

**Unfortunately till this point we don't have that many tutorials. We would
appreciate help creating those. The API Reference and the Sample Project will be
your friend for now.**

If you want to know some more advanced things of engine, consider the [API Documentation](https://larszauberer.github.io/Hekate)

If you can't find what you are searching for, want to show some creations or give feedback, feel free to post things in the [Discussion Section](https://github.com/LarsZauberer/Hekate/discussions)
